# Todogotfree.js


This is a modification based off of a fork from the 
JS port, made by [Dan Hough](http://www.danhough.com/blog/skifree-js/), of SkiFree made by [Chris Pirih](http://ski.ihoc.net/)

the purpose of this is to demo some minigames that our todogotchis can experience as part of their enrichment.  The final version of our app may or may not use this, and we may opt for the traditional memory style games on old-school tamagotchis.

## Features so far:

* Surfing down a never-ending wave with randomly-generated waves and whales, which do not have transparent backgrounds
* Collision detection with obstacles - and the appropriate reaction
* Turning left and right
* Stopping
* OctoCorn's evil uncle might eat you at the end.
* Distance tracking so you can see how far you've gone, because you care.
* Speed boost: aka the cheater F Key
* eddie currents and small whale jump boost
* Big whales 'spout' & crashing into them both whilst surfing and jumping

## So, what's left to do?

* c64 or lsdj style minisoundtrack 
* and sound effects

* Rocks
* fast surfers
* floaters
* william boogie boarding by
* ending moster eat


per original instructions from Dan Hough's original port
## I like to run Unit tests before I do ANYTHING.

* Right, well first you need to do an `npm install`
* Run `mocha` and you should see some beautiful passing tests
