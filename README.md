# Todogotfree.js


This App is based off Skifree.js made by [Dan Hough](http://www.danhough.com/blog/skifree-js/), of SkiFree made by [Chris Pirih](http://ski.ihoc.net/) who also has nice hoodies for sale through his cafepress page.

the purpose of this is to demo some minigames that our todogotchis can experience as part of their enrichment.  Future versions of our app may or may not use this, I was really in a Windows 3.1 mindset when I started this project- and we may opt for the traditional memory style games on old-school tamagotchis.

## Features so far:

* Surfing down a never-ending wave with randomly-generated waves and whales, which do not have transparent backgrounds
* Collision detection with obstacles - and the appropriate reaction
* Turning left and right
* Stopping
* OctoCorn's evil uncle might eat you at the end.
* Distance tracking so you can see how far you've gone, because you care.
* eddie currents and small whale jump boost
* Big rocks 'splahs' & crashing into them both whilst surfing and jumping
* monster will eat you... eventually or if you mash M a bunch and slow down
* F triggers the topsecret fast mode that was also in the original original game.

## So, what's left to do?

* c64 or lsdj style minisoundtrack 
* and sound effects

* floaters (slow surfers)
* william boogie boarding by
* Boats going up the canvas

I kept object Id terms and boilerplate pretty much the same, i've altered 'collision' sligtly to fit todogotchi's theme.  next iteration is a different canvas style game similiar to the theme of this one.
